# String Arbiter
This small piece of Java code allows the transition from Strings to the following types:
- Integer
- Double
- Char

This program takes in a string as a parameter, then based on which method you use, will return that respective type iff the string entered can be converted to be of that type. For example, if a string consisted completely of numbers, StringArbiter would let you directly convert that into a int data type. StringArbiter already includes feedbacks, making implementation much easier.

Please notice the use of static methods, as provided in the tester program.
