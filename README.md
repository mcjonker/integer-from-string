# String Arbiter
This small piece of Java code can be used to insure that an entered string is of a valid type:
- Integer
- Double
- Char

A user can use the included static methods to intake a value and make sure it is of the desired type so that the program does not simply try to use a random string as an integer, double, or char and ultimately crash due to an exception. While try-catch systems are robust, StringArbiter already includes feedbacks, making implementation much easier, and less work.

Please notice the use of static methods, as provided in the tester program.
